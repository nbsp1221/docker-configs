## Services

### [`development-all`](https://github.com/nbsp1221/dockerized-services/blob/main/development-all/Dockerfile)

```shell
docker pull retn0/development-all
```

This is development environment tailored specifically to my needs that supports Node.js, Python, and more.
It includes many common development tools and packages pre-installed, so if you happen to have similar needs and preferences, you can simply use it out of the box.
